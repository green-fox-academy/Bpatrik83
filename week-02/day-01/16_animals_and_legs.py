# Write a program that asks for two integers
# The first represents the number of chickens the farmer has
# The seconf represents the number of pigs the farmer has
# It should print how many legs all the animals have

pigs = input("How many pigs do you have: ")

print((int(chicken) * 2) + (int(pigs) * 4))
